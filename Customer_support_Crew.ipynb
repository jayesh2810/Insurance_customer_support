Complete Pre-existing disease coverage Covers travel cost if you missed a connection due to carrier not running on Schedule What is travel insurance? Travel insurance is a risk management system that provides financial protection to policyholders when travelling. As a type of insurance, it acts as a contract between the insurer and policyholder, guaranteeing financial protection up to a particular sum in the form of compensation or reimbursement.  Travellers can claim this financial protection when faced with various medical and non-medical trip-related risks. These risks range from hospitalisation to medical expenses, loss of checked-in luggage or passports, cancellation or disruption of flights, and various other expenses.  Travel insurance covers the traveller from the date of departure until they arrive back at the place of origin. However, in certain circumstances, like trip cancellation, travellers are covered from the moment of purchasing the policy.  Types of Travel Insurance Plans in India Travellers planning to secure their trips with travel insurance should note that there are several different types of travel insurance, depending on their specific needs. Here are various types of travel insurance plans offered by insurers in India: Travel protection policy: These plans cover basic travel risks such as flight delay or cancellation that most insurers provide. Although they offer limited coverage in comparison to travel insurance, their premium amount is comparatively low, as they are offered as add-ons when purchasing travel tickets. Travel health insurance: Travel health insurance offers comprehensive  health insurance plans when travelling, enabling travellers to avail themselves of financial protection from any medical expenses incurred while travelling.

Difference between Health Insurance and Travel Insurance Health insurance and travel insurance are different types of insurance that serve various purposes. While health insurance is a risk management system that financially protects travellers from medical expenses, travel insurance protects travellers from both medical and non-medical trip-related expenses when travelling. As a company that offers both health insurance and travel insurance, while Niva Bupa offers health insurance with world-class international health coverage, travel insurance provides more significant coverage for non-medical risks as well, mitigating their financial impact and protecting travellers.  Travellers can refer to the following table for a clearer understanding of the differences between Health and Travel Insurance: Scope Health Insurance Travel Insurance What does it do? A comprehensive health insurance policy covers medical risks and expenses one might encounter in one's everyday life and certain critical illnesses during hospitalisation, outpatient care, and other times.    Unlike medical insurance, which compensates or reimburses only medical expenses, health insurance covers several other facets, including diagnostics and preventative care. Travel insurance provides financial protection from expenses incurred due to covered risks in the form of compensation or reimbursement when travelling.    This financial protection is offered in the form of coverage for medical risks, non-medical travel-related risks, and some miscellaneous risks. Extent of coverage The scope and extent of coverage for health insurance varies depending on the specific policy and the sum assured opted for. The scope and extent of coverage vary between different plans and policies; however, Niva Bupa offers three different plans with varying degrees of comprehensiveness to choose from for their policy. Who is it for? A health insurance policy is for anyone who wishes to mitigate the medical and surgical expenses they may incur when getting treatment.  A travel insurance policy is for individuals and groups planning to travel anywhere in the world and looking to secure their trip from unexpected expenses arising from travel-related risks. As foreign travel is expensive, the financial impact of these risks can be severe, but with travel insurance, travellers can explore the world with peace of mind. Does it work abroad? Typical health insurance policies do not work internationally and are only limited to domestic risks. However, certain specialised health insurance policies, such as Niva Bupa’s Aspire, offer coverage for medical treatments from anywhere in the world with its borderless benefit.

As a traveller, there are several reasons why you should buy travel insurance to secure your trip. From medical risks to non-medical trip-related or miscellaneous risks, travellers can experience financial protection and travel with peace of mind when facing them. Some of the common reasons that make travel insurance necessary are: People are more prone to medical problems in a foreign land, be it within India or overseas, due to a number of factors, from changes in food habits to environmental reasons. Travel insurance helps tackle such circumstances with ease. It protects against baggage losses at airports, theft, and travel scams in many tourist destinations. Travel insurance protects the policyholder in the event of flight delay or cancellation. It protects you in the event of natural calamities, man-made disasters, flight hijacking, etc. Student travellers can also opt for study interruption coverage in their travel plans. Travel insurance may cover fatalities and repatriation of mortal remains. Travel insurance is a mandatory requirement in more than 30 countries. It is a prerequisite for visa processing while travelling to these countries. When to Buy Travel Insurance? Travellers are typically advised to buy travel insurance immediately after booking their flight and reserving accommodation. This ensures that if, for certain covered reasons, your trip is cancelled, you can receive compensation for the non-recoverable travel and accommodation expenses paid in advance. In addition to this, as travel insurance does not go through sales or offer additional benefits even if you wait, it is thus directly beneficial to purchase the policy as soon as possible.  If you intend to embark on multiple trips for a set duration, such as within a year, you should buy a travel plan in advance to cover all the upcoming trips with an annual multi trip insurance. And even in the case of a single trip, buying a travel plan in advance is advisable. However, if you forget to secure your trip in time, Niva Bupa enables travellers to purchase the policy from anywhere at any time before starting their journey within just a few minutes and in as few as five steps.  So you can also buy travel plans at the last minute even if you miss out on crucial coverages and benefits. Who Should Buy a Travel Insurance Plan? While it is mandatory to have travel insurance before visiting certain countries, people travelling abroad to any country, in general, should buy a travel insurance plan to secure their trip. Along with this, it is advisable for the following travellers to buy a travel insurance plan:  Individual travellers and families  Senior citizens - because of their higher medical susceptibility  Corporate travellers can cover their travel risks while travelling on behalf of their organisation  Students can buy student-specific travel plans with longer validity  People travelling in groups can insist on the purchase of travel insurance by their tour organiser Domestic travellers can buy travel plans designed to cover travel risks within the country How to Compare Travel Insurance Online?

Considerations Before Buying Travel Insurance Policy Before purchasing any policy, travellers must consider several factors to determine and avail themselves of the best coverage for their specific needs. These factors vary from personal details to the destination you would be travelling to. Some of the factors that you need to consider before buying a travel insurance policy are: Duration: Travellers should consider how long they will be travelling for and consider opting for a plan with higher coverage if the duration is relatively long. The longer a trip is, the more susceptible a traveller becomes to certain risks. In addition to this, if travellers have several trips planned in a year, opting for multi-trip insurance is beneficial as it is cheaper and more convenient than opting for a policy every time.  Nature of the Trip: Choose the plan according to the nature of your trip and what you will be doing there. Travellers planning to go skydiving should only do so after first securing their trip with adventure sports coverage, which is an exclusion (i.e. not covered) unless chosen as an add-on.  Sum Assured: Estimate your travel risk and finalise your sum assured accordingly. The sum assured is the total amount you can claim, depending on the specific policy opted for. Optional Covers: Review the list of available add-on covers and select judiciously based on your specific needs. Selecting unnecessary covers will only escalate the premium. Exclusions: There are several specified circumstances or conditions under which travel insurance is not applicable and is considered not covered. Always familiarise yourself with the exclusions before buying the travel plan to avoid any last-minute hassles. How to Calculate Travel Insurance Premiums Online? Travellers looking to secure their trip with travel insurance online can easily calculate the premium prices and determine how much a policy will cost. To do so, a traveller should simply visit the Niva Bupa website and follow the process to purchase the policy. I.e. Fill in the trip details traveller details, choose one of the three plans, select a sum assured, and add any add-ons if applicable. Once these details are added, Niva Bupa will calculate the premium and allow you to preview how much the policy will cost for your trip. Factors That Affect Your Travel Insurance Premium As a traveller planning to buy travel insurance to secure your trip, it is essential to note that several factors impact the premium of travel insurance. Here are some of the key factors which affect travel insurance premiums: Trip duration The duration of a trip significantly impacts the travel insurance premium as it is directly correlational to the risk a traveller might be exposed to, thus leading to an increase in premium.  Trip destination Insurers like Niva Bupa divide the world into several regions to offer the best policy for travellers based on their needs. These regions are Asia Pacific, Worldwide excluding the USA and Canada, and Worldwide including USA and Canada. Based on this division, travellers can select a higher sum assured and get additional coverage when visiting a particular destination. Due to this, the premium cost charged for the policy also differs between various countries. Sum assured The higher the sum assured, the higher the premium charged. This is because the premium correlates with the sum assured or the total coverage a policy offers. Plan selected Whether you opt for a lite, basic, or comprehensive plan, the premium for the policy increases as the degree of coverage increases. Type of policy opted for  Travellers can also witness a difference in premiums depending on the policy type. For example, Niva Bupa offers single-trip and student travel insurance as part of its policies. The premium for travellers opting for student travel insurance will differ from that for single-trip travel insurance. Any particular add-ons opted for Travel insurance policies, such as student travel insurance, have specific add-ons for travellers to choose from based on their specific needs. For example, student travellers can opt for complete pre-existing disease coverage, which can increase the premium. Age of the travellers In certain cases, the age of the traveller also significantly impacts the premium, as older travellers, such as senior citizens, might be more susceptible to certain risks, leading to higher premiums. What the traveller would do on the trip In some instances, such as when a traveller is going to take part in dangerous activities such as adventure sports, the premium will be higher compared to others. Number of travellers Niva Bupa offers groups of travellers with more than two individuals a 10% discount on the overall premium, thus reducing the premium cost. How to Lower Your Travel Health Insurance Premium It is important for travellers to note that it is not possible to unilaterally lower their trip premium; however, depending on the specific choices they make, they can opt for a plan that costs less.  Select a lower sum assured: Select a lower sum assured to reduce your premium. Travel with more travellers: Travelling with more than two travellers in the same plan offers a 10% discount on the premium. Consider the travel duration: The longer the policy period, the higher the premium cost is. Consider the destination: Some destinations have a higher premium cost than other regions.

List of Countries Where Travel Insurance is Mandatory In 2024, over 30 countries, including those in the Schengen Area, have mandated travel insurance as a criterion for entry. From making it a requirement for a visa to having it checked during customs and immigration, there are several ways by which these countries require travel insurance from Indians. Here is a list of some of the countries mandating travel insurance for Indians: Myths on Travel Insurance As with any other insurance policy, travellers looking for travel insurance often encounter several myths and misunderstandings about travel insurance, which can lead to confusion and opting for an improper policy with lacking coverage as a compromise, furthering the myths. Here are some common myths that travellers often face when researching travel insurance and explanations for why they are myths.  I don’t need travel insurance for a short trip This is false, as risks do not wait for anything or anyone to cause financial hardships. So there is no lesser risk of unnecessary expenses by travelling for three days rather than five. From trip cancellation to loss of checked-in baggage, any risk that can impact travellers on a longer trip is also applicable to travellers on a shorter trip. I am fit and healthy and do not require travel insurance Travel insurance covers medical risks and non-medical trip-related risks, which can lead to significant financial loss and a negative travel experience if not considered or taken precautions for. Travel insurance is expensive India has some of the cheapest travel insurance plans while offering similar coverage. Not only does Niva Bupa offer coverages for up to $500,000, but the premium charged for it is competitive and affordable for most travellers. My claims will be denied This depends on the specific plan, insurer, and particular incident. Travellers should know that leading insurers like Niva Bupa do everything to ensure quick, efficient, and hassle-free claim settlement, but it is important to know and follow the procedure to have your genuine claims settled. I will need to buy different plans for each member of my family That is not true; insurers like Niva Bupa make it very convenient for travellers to secure their family members with the same policy, making the process much more convenient and cost-effective. If you travel with two or more people, you can also get a 10% discount on the premium. Travel insurance covers everything  Travellers should know that travel insurance does not cover everything, and every policy has certain limitations, exclusions, and conditions for eligibility. It is essential to understand these limitations and act accordingly. Travel insurance does not cover senior citizens This is not true. While different insurers have varying maximum age limits, they offer coverage for seniors up to the age of 70. With Niva Bupa, senior citizens can avail themselves of comprehensive travel insurance. COVID-19 Coverage In 2024, most of the world has overcome COVID-19 on a global scale, reducing the scope and impact of these risks. There has been a significant drop in the number of active cases, as recorded by the WHO, with around 147,000 new cases reported from the 1st to the 28th of April, a 48% drop from the previous month, from the 4th to the 31st of March. However, despite this reduction, travellers must consider these risks when travelling abroad.  In the past, due to the global scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and the requirements set by many countries, travel insurance with COVID-19 coverage became mandatory for travellers visiting certain countries. However, as the scope and extent of the global pandemic has subsided, so have the requirements set up by many countries requiring travel insurance with COVID-19 coverage.  Despite this change, Niva Bupa’s TravelAssure policy still offers COVID-19 hospitalisation coverage up to the sum assured. Accordingly, if you are infected or test positive for COVID-19 during your overseas stay, the travel health insurance plan will bear the cost of your treatment and hospitalisation. In almost all countries, a COVID-19 infection leads to the applicability of strict isolation rules, and it is addressed as per their SOP when detected. Therefore, adequate COVID-19 coverage can be handy in times of need. Get a Quote in 2 minutes!

As a traveller planning an international trip, travel health insurance is an integral investment that must be considered for every journey, from offering financial protection in the form of compensation or reimbursement for dozens of covered risks to enabling quality treatment at a hospital. In addition to this, at least 30 countries mandate travellers to have travel health insurance as a requirement for entry. Can I buy travel insurance after departure? No, while travellers can buy travel insurance to secure their trip up to boarding their flight, it is not possible to do so once the traveller has started on their journey. Travellers looking for international insurance for travel should typically get insurance as soon as they book their flight tickets and confirm accommodation. However, if for some reason their flight is delayed, it is possible to buy the policy from anywhere at any time before starting on their journey.  What is a pre-existing condition for travel Insurance? A pre-existing condition is a pre-diagnosed ailment or condition that a traveller is already aware of before getting a policy. While travellers do not need to go through a pre-policy check-up to avail of travel insurance, it is still mandatory to share a medical declaration with any pre-existing conditions when purchasing the policy. It is imperative to declare any pre-existing diseases and conditions when purchasing the policy to avoid claim rejection if an already known ailment is the reason for the loss. When is the best time to purchase a travel insurance policy? The best time to purchase travel insurance is as soon as you book your flight tickets and make hotel reservations. That is because, from the moment you buy the policy, you can avail of coverages such as trip delay, trip cancellation, missed connection, and several others that will protect you from the financial consequences of these risks. While there is no benefit to purchasing travel insurance later, it makes all the difference when buying policies sooner rather than later.  Do I need to buy travel insurance for short trips as well? Yes, travel insurance for international travel is recommended regardless of the duration of a specific trip. While the potential risk increases the longer a particular trip is, that does not mean that short trips are immune from them. So, regardless of the length of the journey, travellers need to consider these risks and opt for the right travel insurance policy to secure themselves and their loved ones.  Is there a timeframe for filing a claim under my travel insurance? While there is no pre-determined timeframe for filing a claim under travel insurance, most policies require travellers to file a claim request within 30 to 90 days of the incident happening. While travellers facing medical expenses can potentially request a claim instantly through the TPA, it is important to file the claim earlier rather than later for other incidents and risks.  View More Trending Articles A Guide to Family Travel Insurance | Niva Bupa Know about family travel insurance, what is travel insurance, its types and benefits.
